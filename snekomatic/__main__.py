    Hey @{username}, it looks like that was the first time we merged one of
    your PRs! Thanks so much! :tada: :birthday:

    If you want to keep contributing, we'd love to have you. So, I just sent
    you an invitation to join the python-trio organization on Github! If you
    accept, then here's what will happen:

    * Github will automatically subscribe you to notifications on all our
      repositories. (But you can unsubscribe again if you don't want the
      spam.)

    * You'll be able to help us manage issues (add labels, close them, etc.)

    * You'll be able to review and merge other people's pull requests

    * You'll get a [member] badge next to your name when posting here, and
      you'll have the option of adding your name to our [member's
      page](https://github.com/orgs/python-trio/people) and putting our icon
      on your Github profile
      ([details](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership))

    If you want to read more, [here's the relevant section in our contributing
    guide](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#joining-the-team).

    If you decline, then you can still submit PRs, but I won't hassle you
    again. And if you ever change your mind, just let us know, and we'll send
    another invitation. Or, you can ignore the invitation entirely, and it'll
    still be there for you later. You should do whatever's best for you!

    If you have any questions, well... I am just a humble Python script, so I
    probably can't help. But feel free to post a comment here, or [in our
    chat](https://gitter.im/python-trio/general), or [on our
    forum](https://trio.discourse.group/c/help-and-advice), whatever's
    easiest, and someone will help you out!
