I added a remote by doing:
  git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/ancient-ocean-35232.git
I'm not planning to use this remote ever because I have heroku's github integration set up to auto-deploy whenever I push to master. But by having it, the heroku CLI tool can automatically figure out which app I want without having to specify it all the time

Right now it's running with DEBUG=true, ENV=prod, but this doesn't actually affect much inside octomachinery â€“ AFAICT it just sets some config variables, and sets some default logging levels to DEBUG


If heroku puts the app to sleep, then it seems to wake up again in about 5 seconds, and does receive the webhook that woke it up (at least in one test)
so that suggests a hobby plan is fine for our purposes
